	export default defineConfig({
		plugins: [
			tailwindcss(),
		],
		// Importante para que Vite procese ambos HTML
		build: {
			rollupOptions: {
				input: {
					main: 'index.html',
					new_property: 'new_property.html', // Asegúrate del nombre exacto
				}
			}
		}
	})

    "start": "npm run test && vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview"
  },
